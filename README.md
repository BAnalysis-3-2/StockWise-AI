AI Demand forecasting and Inventory Optimization System

BACKGROUND:

South African small and medium enterprises (SMEs) and township retailers often struggle with significant inventory mismanagement, leading to substantial financial losses. Traditional methods for demand forecasting, which rely on static spreadsheets and intuition, are unable to keep up with good market behavior, resulting in poor inventory decisions. This leads to overstocking, which ties up capital and increases storage costs, as well as understocking, which results in lost sales and dissatisfied customers. To address these problems, our project introduces an AI-powered system designed to accurately forecast product demand and optimize inventory levels in real-time. This solution aims to give access to advanced technology, empowering local retailers with the tools to make smarter, data-driven decisions, increases operational efficiency, and contribute to the economic growth of their communities.# Student_Portfolio

Objective:

The objectives of the AI Demand Forecasting and Inventory Optimization System are multifaceted, aiming to improve business performance for South African retailers. The project seeks to achieve over 90% demand forecasting accuracy within six months, which will directly lead to a reduction in stockouts and excess inventory. A key financial objective is to generate more than R1 million in collective savings for participating SMEs and increase their average profit margins, demonstrating a strong ROI within 18 months. The system also has a revenue goal of R2 million within the first year by offering subscription-based access and establishing strategic partnerships. Finally, the project aims for broad market penetration by deploying the system across 100 retail outlets in Gauteng within 24 months, with a goal of achieving a 90% user adoption rate and establishing itself as the leading AI inventory management platform in the region.
