<h1>AI Demand forecasting and Inventory Optimization System</h1>

<h3>Problem Definition</h3>

SMEs in South Africa often struggle with inventory mismanagement due to inaccurate demand forecasting. This project addresses this problem by providing an AI-driven solution aligned with the theme of "AI Solution for Industries." The benefits of this AI in solving this issue can lead to improved decision-making.


<h3>Key Features</h3>

- Demand Forecasting: Combines LSTM, XGBoost, and ARIMA models
                      Adapts to diverse retail environments and consumer behaviors.
- Inventory Optimization: Recommends optimal stock levels to minimize stockouts and overstocking.
                          Dynamic safety stock calculations based on demand volatility.
- Retail Intelligence Chatbot: Provides a user-friendly interface for SMEs to access inventory insights.
                               Offers natural language processing for inventory questions and automatic business alerts.
- Data Integration: Integrate retail data, social media sentiment, and weather patterns to give data for the model.
- Scalability:  Designed to be deployed across diverse retail environments.


<h3>Business Objectives</h3>

The primary business objectives of this project are to increase demand forecasting accuracy, minimize stockouts and overstock situations, improve inventory turnover rates, and provide accessible AI-driven insights for SME retailers. The ultimate goal is to enhance operational efficiency, reduce waste, and improve the financial performance of these businesses.

<h3>Business Success Criteria</h3>

- Achieve at least 90% demand forecasting accuracy.
- Reduce stockouts by 15% and overstock by 10%.
- Increase inventory turnover by 20%.
- Achieve 85% user adoption rate among SME retailers.


<h3>Business Background</h3>

Inventory mismanagement challenges for SMEs lead to reduced scalability and profitability. This project aims to support 4IR goals by enhancing AI for business operations in this domain. This enables intelligent forecasting tools and increases productivity.


<h3>Requirements</h3>

 <h4>Functional Requirements</h4>
 
- Data Acquisition: Extract and integrate retail sales, economic trends, and social media sentiment.
- Model Training: Train and optimize hybrid ensemble forecasting models.
- API Development: Create APIs for integration with retail systems and chatbot (if applicable).
- Reporting: Generate insightful reports.

<h4>Non-Functional Requirements</h4>

- Security: Ensure compliance with South African privacy laws.
- Scalability: The system must handle increasing data volumes.
- Accuracy: Provide high-accuracy demand forecasting results.
- User-Friendliness: Develop intuitive interfaces for the chatbot.


  <h3>AI Solution</h3>

To address the problem, this project focuses on implementing an AI-driven system. It combines diverse data sources such as retail sales, economic trends, and social media sentiment. It implements the use of hybrid ensemble models for accurate time-series sales information and forecasting, with the option to implement and make use of the chatbot for the stakeholders to interact with.


<h3>Initial Assessment of Tools and Techniques</h3>

- Machine Learning Platform: Python-based ML stack using scikit-learn, XGBoost, TensorFlow/Keras.
- Time Series Forecasting: Prophet, ARIMA, LSTM networks.
- Data Integration: Data is pre-processed using Python libraries.

<h3>Machine Learning Approach</h3>

*   The AI Demand Forecasting and Inventory Optimization System utilizes a Hybrid Ensemble Model that combines multiple forecasting approaches to maximize accuracy across different product categories, time horizons, and market conditions.
*   Pre-trained models on large retail datasets enable quick adaptation to new stores with limited historical data through domain adaptation and few-shot learning techniques.
*   Machine learning pipelines automatically extract relevant features from raw data including lag variables, rolling statistics, seasonal indicators, and external factor correlations.
*   Continuous performance tracking with automated retraining triggers ensures models stay current with changing market dynamics and maintain forecasting accuracy.

<h4>How it Learns:</h4>
   Processes sequences of historical sales data to
   identify complex temporal dependencies and patterns that
   traditional time series methods miss. The LSTM architecture

 <h3>Constraints</h3>

- Data Quality: Potential inconsistencies in historical sales data.
- Adoption Risk: Resistance from retailers comfortable with manual processes.
- Technical Integration: Difficulties integrating with diverse POS systems.

<h4>Risks</h4>

- Data Quality Risk: Inconsistent or incomplete sales data compromise forecast accuracy.
- Adoption Risk: Resistance to change from manual processes.
- Technical Risk: Integration challenges with legacy systems.
- Market Risk: Economic volatility affecting models.
- Scalability Risk: System degradation.
